# Smart-Home
Smart Home Automation
Overview
This project, Smart-Home, is a home automation system designed to control and monitor smart devices such as lights, switches, or sensors. It leverages [insert technologies, e.g., Python, MQTT, ESP8266, Raspberry Pi] to enable automation, remote access, and device integration for a customizable smart home experience.
Features

Device Control: Manage devices like lights, fans, or plugs via [insert interface, e.g., web app, mobile app, or CLI].
Automation Rules: Create triggers for automated actions (e.g., turn on lights at dusk).
Remote Monitoring: Access device status remotely using [insert protocol, e.g., MQTT, HTTP].
Extensibility: Add support for new devices or protocols easily.

Requirements

Hardware: [Specify hardware, e.g., Raspberry Pi 4, ESP32, PIR sensors, relays].
Software: [List dependencies, e.g., Python 3.8+, Node.js, Mosquitto MQTT broker].
Network: Wi-Fi or local network for device communication.
Tools: Git, [other tools, e.g., Arduino IDE, PlatformIO].

Installation

Clone the Repository:git clone https://github.com/gadhavevaishnavi/Smart-Home.git
cd Smart-Home


Install Dependencies:
For software dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt

ornpm install


For hardware, flash firmware using [e.g., esptool, Arduino IDE].


Configure Settings:
Create a .env file in the root directory:MQTT_BROKER=your_broker_ip
MQTT_PORT=1883
WIFI_SSID=your_wifi_ssid
WIFI_PASSWORD=your_wifi_password


Update configuration files in config/ (if applicable).


Set Up Hardware:
Connect devices as per [insert wiring guide, e.g., docs/wiring.md].
Ensure devices are powered and networked.



Usage

Run the Application:python main.py

ornode index.js


Access the Interface:
Open [insert interface, e.g., http://localhost:8080] in a browser or use [insert app].


Configure Automations:
Edit config/automations.yaml to define rules (e.g., turn off lights at midnight).


Monitor Devices:
Check status via [insert method, e.g., dashboard, scripts/monitor.py].
