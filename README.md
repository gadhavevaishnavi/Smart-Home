🌟 Welcome to the Smart Home Revolution! 🌟
Step Into the Future
Transform your home into a futuristic haven with the Smart-Home project!

✨ Spellbinding Features

Command Your Castle: Control lights, fans, or smart plugs with a flick of your app or a tap on your dashboard.
Automation Alchemy: Conjure rules to make your home react—lights glow at dusk, fans spin when it’s too warm.
Remote Wizardry: Peek into your home’s status from afar using [insert protocol, e.g., MQTT, HTTP].
Endless Enchantments: Expand your setup with new devices or integrations, like adding potions to a cauldron.
